# UFOs
## Overview of the project
The purpose of the project is to create a webpage using JavaScript and HTML to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria (date, city, state, country, and shape) at the same time.

## Results
1. Four full-resolution Mars hemisphere image URLs and titles were scraped from the Mars website.

3. After adding Bootstrap 3 components, the web app has been made mobile-responsive. Also, by styling the webpage, the "Scrape New Data" button has been changed to 'success' green color,

 and all the headings have been changed to red symbolizing Mars color.
